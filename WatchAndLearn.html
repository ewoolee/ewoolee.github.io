                         <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
                        <p>We began by brainstorming to explore how we might involve storytelling in our solution, encouraging quantity of ideas regardless of how wild or crazy it might sound. We then used affinity mapping to group ideas, which helped us discover themes such as learning, creativity support tools, film, stars (astrology), and scrapbooking to name a few. After voting among ourselves, we decided to pursue the idea of developing a language learning tool based on an archive of stories shared by users in different languages with varying difficulty.</p>

                         Through document analysis and initial interviews with people who have been learning a language, we found that they enjoy learning by consuming content (e.g. watching television or movies). We saw a potential area for storytelling in the interviewees’ desire to communicate with and understand the stories of people around them. From these insights, we settled on using anime to deliver materials for language learners because it is a form of media that has storylines and characters that viewers can invest in. We further narrowed down our user group into people who already have a primary means of learning a language or are already at a basic proficiency since we needed to balance the anime watching experience with the amount of material that can be presented to a user during their viewing.

                                    Pains: Paola works at a hospital in Oakland, where she treats many patients who speak Japanese and limited English. She learned Japanese in high school and wants to brush up on it and improve her Japanese because she wants to connect with her patients on a more personal level, but she doesn’t have time and money to spend on private lessons or formal classes. Being an avid Netflix watcher and podcast listener, she wishes learning Japanese could be just as fun and engaging.

                     <p> After targeting anime watcher, we thought it makes the most sense to have the app teach Japanese. However,  none of us spoke the language; so we decided to use English because it would be easier for us to design a curriculum and easier to find and work with dataset for machine learning.</p>

                            We then derived user needs from the interviews and document analysis, including the need for users to assess their  progress, the need for a balance between immersion and structured lesson plans, and the need for users to set their own pace. We then transformed these needs into wireframes. Initial assessment would ask users to self-report their proficiency level, which would be matched with anime series that machine learning classified as being appropriate for their proficiency. You can find a detailed description of how we incorporated machine learning on our final report <span id="underline"><a href="Team3_Team%20Rocket_Final%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></span>. Once the user chooses one of the recommended anime and watches an episode, they will be presented with a quiz to assess what they learned.

                        <p>Conducting wizard of Oz evaluations with our classmates revealed that users want to see a variety of questions (e.g. vocabulary, plot, grammar). We also explored whether users would like to see quick tips while watching anime, and the general consensus was that they would like to have the option to view it or not - so we added a little pop-up at the top of the playback screen that can be tapped to view quick tips about words and phrases involved at the current playback time. Some users suggested we have a list of words to look out for before watching an episode, so we decided to incorporate a pre-episode vocabulary list detailing what the pop-ups would show throughout the episode.</p>
